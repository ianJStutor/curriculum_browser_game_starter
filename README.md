## Curriculum

Complete curriculum support materials and code for teaching (starter) JavaScript engineering through game design in the browser. There are multiple versions of the final code base, each based on the following proficiency levels:
- [ ] Novice (learning syntax and computer science thinking)
- [x] **Beginner (learning app dev and engineering thinking)**
- [ ] Competent (learning algorithms and paradigm thinking)
- [ ] Proficient (learning data management and system-wide thinking)
- [x] **Expert (learning full-stack web dev and best-practices thinking)**

## Requirements

* Beginner-level familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript syntax. I've used my own curricula or Free Code Camp for this.
* Beginner-level familiarity with canvas drawing. I've used my own curricula or Code Maven for this.
* Live server. I've taught this course to young students using Glitch or Repl, which works well because learners get a live URL to share with friends.

## Description

Starter files for any game design project using the browser and the HTML <code>canvas</code> element. Students learn:
* Separation of concerns
* Module pattern
* Animation loop
* System engineering thinking

Built with vanilla JavaScript, my favorite flavor!
